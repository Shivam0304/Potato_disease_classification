Project: AI-Powered Potato Disease Classification
Description:
Developed an AI-driven deep learning model to classify potato leaf diseases with high accuracy, aiming to revolutionize precision agriculture and early disease detection. Leveraged CNN-based architectures trained on labeled datasets of healthy and diseased potato leaves, optimizing performance through transfer learning, hyperparameter tuning, and data augmentation.To ensure real-world usability, deployed the trained model as a FastAPI-based REST API, making it accessible for integration into agricultural applications. Containerized the entire deployment using Docker, enabling seamless scalability and cross-platform compatibility.

Key Achievements:
âœ… Achieved high classification accuracy through optimized CNN architectures
âœ… Deployed the model via a FastAPI-based RESTful service for real-time predictions
âœ… Containerized the application with Docker for scalable and efficient deployment
âœ… Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization
âœ… Developed an end-to-end pipeline, from data preprocessing to deployment
âœ… Showcased AIâ€™s role in precision agriculture and disease detection

Docker command:-

docker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 -v D:\dl_project\potato_disease_classification:/potato_disease_classification tensorflow/serving --rest_api_port=8501 --model_config_file=/potato_disease_classification/model.config


Steps:-

1. activate the api by uvicorn main:app --reload
2. check postman by sending an image (use url generated by running api to send the image)
3. open docker to activate tf/serving
4. open terminal and run the docker command 
5. can check if models are uploaded properly by using url generated in cp/ written in api by removing word 'predict'
6. open frontend dir in cp and run 'npm run start' to launch the website.
