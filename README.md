Project: AI-Powered Potato Disease Classification
Description:
Developed an AI-driven deep learning model to classify potato leaf diseases with high accuracy, aiming to revolutionize precision agriculture and early disease detection. Leveraged CNN-based architectures trained on labeled datasets of healthy and diseased potato leaves, optimizing performance through transfer learning, hyperparameter tuning, and data augmentation.To ensure real-world usability, deployed the trained model as a FastAPI-based REST API, making it accessible for integration into agricultural applications. Containerized the entire deployment using Docker, enabling seamless scalability and cross-platform compatibility.
